      "message": "Constructor using 10 params , but allowed only 7. I applied this builder pattern for 3 of the classes. \nThere is also build interface in Factory class, which too have many params. \nBut that needs more deep analysis of code. Hence i did not do it in this code. \nHope this is right. If yes, then I will try to do for Factory as well. \nPlease let me know your review comments.",
