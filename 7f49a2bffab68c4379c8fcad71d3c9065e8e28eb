      "message": "There  are two problems.  1) The variable badparms is supposed to be a list of bad parameters.  You are not creating a list with tempBadParms.  You are assigning single values to it. 2) You never assign tempBadParms (which I assume you meant to be a list) back to badparams.  badparams is a string that is passed in by the parent method and when you are done updating it, the badparams is utilized in a log and exception message at the parent/calling level.\n\nI think your assignment statements should have been:\ntempBadParams \u003d tempBadParams.concat(\"whatever the param\");\n\nThen at the bottom: \nbadparams \u003d badparams.concat(tempBadParams);\n\nBut, this is all more complicated than the original code.",
