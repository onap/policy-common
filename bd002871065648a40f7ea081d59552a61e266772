      "message": "On first question, good question, the answer is that it works fine for Logger too. I added a test case for it.\n\nThe logback.xml was there before this review but, I agree, it could cause problems especially as you can\u0027t guarantee what order the various logback.xml files are in the classpath. Log4j will use the first one it comes across, something I know from having spent many hours checking why logging changes I was making in a certain logback.xml were not showing up where I needed them.",
