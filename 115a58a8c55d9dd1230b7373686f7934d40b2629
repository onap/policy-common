      "message": "I\u0027m looking at the transitive dependencies on common-parameters since added here.   It introduces one with \"snakeyaml\" 1.21.   \n\nI also see in policy/models/pom.xml snakeyaml 1.18, and\n\n./models/models-interactions/model-yaml/pom.xml snakeyaml 1.17.\n\nAt runtime, the one that seems to \"win\" in the pdp-d is 1.18.\n\nWe should open a JIRA to clean out all these multiple versions of dependencies, fix them in policy/parent and do some regression tests.   I think Jim had some issue to migrate to 1.21 if I recall correctly in common-parameters, but it does not seem to get carried to runtime, at least in the pdp-d with all the versions.\n\nAgreement on open a JIRA on this?",
