      "message": "I have found it very useful to have it work this way for junit tests, as it clues me into the fact that the registry hasn\u0027t been cleared - something that could easily be lost in the log.  Would it be acceptable to add a \"registerOrReplace()\" method that logs a message and always replaces to value, if it exists?",

      "message": "Yeah, I can see it useful in junits.  \n\nThat would be nice if you can add a new method to support it.   Not sure if there are some \"suffix terminology\" such as the *IfAbsent as in the concurrent hashtable that could be reused to distinguish between the 2 flavors.   Whatever you decide is good with me.   Thank you!",
